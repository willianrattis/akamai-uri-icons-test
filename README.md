# Akamai URI Icons Viewer

This application provides a user-friendly interface to view Akamai-hosted .webp images. It allows users to easily add and view icons with their names and URLs, providing a workaround for direct access issues to Akamai's storage.

## Features

- Add new items by entering the name and the Akamai URL of the image
- View a grid of images with their corresponding names
- Simple and clear interface for managing Akamai-hosted icons

## How to Use

To add a new icon:
1. Click on the "+" button.
2. Fill in the "Item Name" and "Item URL" fields.
3. Click "Add Item" to see the icon appear in the grid on the `view-akamai-icons.html` page.

To clear all items:
1. Click on the "Limpar Itens" button to remove all items from the current view.

## Setup

No additional setup is required. Just clone the repository and open `add-new-item.html` to start adding new icons.
